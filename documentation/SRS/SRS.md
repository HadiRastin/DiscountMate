## 2. Product Overview

The DiscountMate project seeks to empower consumers with the ability to make their lives easier by providing reliable information regarding discounted items of interests from various supermarket chains, affording them the opportunity to save potentially hundreds of dollars off their weekly grocery shopping with minimal effort.
Item information is updated regularly through data collection techniques such as web-scraping, prices are then compared between various providers for the same item and those with the highest potential for savings are presented to consumers.

Additionally, the project aims to employ machine learning and data analysis techniques to identify patterns and predict future discount opportunities, providing consumers with relevant recommendations according to their interests and purchase history.
History is obtained through user interaction methods such as item searches, checking off items on a shopping list to indicate a purchase, and scanning purchase receipts by utilizing optical character recognition (OCR) technology and extracting necessary data.

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The DiscountMate project is a new, self-contained product designed to help consumers save money on their grocery shopping by providing them with reliable information on discounted items from various supermarket chains. It is not part of an existing product family, nor is it a replacement for any specific system. Instead, it serves as a unique platform that combines real-time data collection, machine learning, and user interaction to offer users significant savings and a more streamlined shopping experience.

#### 2.1.1 Context and Origin
DiscountMate emerged from the need to provide consumers with accurate and up-to-date information on discounted products across major supermarket chains. With the rising cost of living and the increased use of technology in everyday life, consumers are looking for smarter ways to shop. DiscountMate addresses this need by allowing users to compare prices, view promotions, and create personalized shopping lists that highlight the best deals.

#### 2.1.2 System Overview
DiscountMate is a standalone application that relies on several key components to deliver its functionality:

##### Data Collection and Integration

The application uses web-scraping techniques to collect data from various supermarket chains, ensuring that product information and pricing are kept up-to-date. Data is   then integrated into the system's database, allowing users to access this information for comparison and recommendation purposes.

##### Machine Learning and Data Analysis:

The system employs machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and predict future discount opportunities.
This capability allows DiscountMate to provide personalized product recommendations based on user interactions, such as search history, shopping list modifications, and scanned purchase receipts (using Optical Character Recognition, or OCR).

##### User Interaction and Personalization
Users can create profiles, enabling them to save shopping lists and rate or comment on purchased items.
The application provides various search and recommendation features to help users find discounted products quickly.
The system also offers a mapping function to help users locate nearby stores and navigate to them.

##### External Interfaces and Integration
DiscountMate can interface with external applications such as mapping software to provide location-based services.
It also integrates with user devices for features like scanning purchase receipts using OCR, which extracts data for further analysis.

#### 2.1.3 Component Relationships and Interactions
The following diagram illustrates the major components of the DiscountMate system and their interactions.

**We need a figure here.**

### 2.2 Product Functions
Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.

### 2.3 Product Constraints
This subsection should provide a general description of any other items that will limit the developerâ€™s options. These may include:  

* Interfaces to users, other applications or hardware.  
* Quality of service constraints.  
* Standards compliance.  
* Constraints around design or implementation.

### 2.4 User Characteristics
Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the pertinent characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the most important user classes for this product from those who are less important to satisfy.

### 2.5 Assumptions and Dependencies
List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the SRS. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project, unless they are already documented elsewhere (for example, in the vision and scope document or the project plan).

### 2.6 Apportioning of Requirements
Apportion the software requirements to software elements. For requirements that will require implementation over multiple software elements, or when allocation to a software element is initially undefined, this should be so stated. A cross reference table by function and software element should be used to summarize the apportioning.

Identify requirements that may be delayed until future versions of the system (e.g., blocks and/or increments).

## 3. Requirements
> This section specifies the software product's requirements.

Identify the data items or messages coming into the system and going out and describe the purpose of each. Describe the services needed and the nature of communications. Refer to documents that describe detailed application programming interface protocols. Identify data that will be shared across software components. If the data sharing mechanism must be implemented in a specific way (for example, use of a global data area in a multitasking operating system), specify this as an implementation constraint.

### 3.2 Functional
#### 3.2.1 Functional Requirement 1 
The system must enable users to view all grocery stores products with up to date catalogue, and all current promotions.

**Rationale**: In order to catch every chance of sales, users should be able to browse all grocery products from catalogue with all the current promotions. This is the key foundation function of the system.

#### 3.2.2  Functional Requirement 2 
The system must enable users to search for products by varying identifiers, included name, brand, price and promotions. 

**Rationale**: Search is a key function for the usage of the system. Users with an idea of their target to buy a product could find out the item quickly from the system. That largely reduces the time users need to find the product from browsing the full product list. 

#### 3.2.3  Functional Requirement 3
The system should auto suggest a list of the recommended product when users types in a product name in the search function.

**Rationale**: The auto suggestion function is part of the recommendation system in the backend which produce recommended product to users based on machine learning algorithm that learned from user shopping habit and shopping transaction records in the system. This function is important in assisting users shopping process.

#### 3.2.4  Functional Requirement 4
